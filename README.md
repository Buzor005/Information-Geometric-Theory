Information Geometry Theory (IGT): A Unified Field FrameworkA single-field scalar theory positing that spacetime curvature, quantum mechanics, and cosmic structure emerge from the relaxation dynamics of a fundamental geometric field. IGT derives quantum phenomena and the dark sector from first principles, resolving core incompatibilities between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.StatusBadgeStatusDescriptionFalsifiability$\checkmark$ Highly TestableIncludes 16 distinct predictions falsifiable by near-future experiments (SKA, JWST, Pulsar Timing Arrays).Completeness$\checkmark$ Unified FrameworkUnifies GR, QM, Mass Generation, and the Dark Sector.Compatibility$\checkmark$ $\mathbf{\Lambda CDM}$ LimitReduces to the Modified Einstein Field Equations with a Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ in the $\mathcal{R} \to 0$ limit.I. Core Axioms and FoundationsIGT is built on the dynamics of the Relational Encoding Field ($\text{R}$), which links information density to geometric structure.The Field Equation ($\text{R}$)The field is defined as the ratio of geometric structure ($\text{G}$, Weyl Curvature) to environmental decoherence ($\Gamma_{\text{dec}}$):$$\boxed{ \text{R}(x) = \text{G}(x) / \Gamma_{\text{dec}}(x) }$$This relationship dictates that high curvature sustains high coherence, and vice versa.Two Time RegimesThe universe transitions from a deterministic bulk reality to an emergent probabilistic surface reality:The Timeless Regime ($\tau$): Evolution is governed by a deterministic Gradient Flow (diffusion equation), where the universe searches for the minimum of the Triple-Well Potential $V(\text{R})$.The Emergent Time ($t$): Physical time begins when the information encoding rate stabilizes. This transition mathematically converts the $\tau$-diffusion equation into the Schrödinger Equation (via stochastic quantization).Geometric Mass GenerationIGT replaces the Higgs mechanism. Particle mass ($m_i$) is the binding energy required to stabilize the local $\text{R}$ field condensation against vacuum pressure.$$\boxed{ m_i = g_i \cdot \text{R}_{\text{core}} }$$II. Key Results and UnificationsIGT provides simultaneous solutions to several major problems in physics:ProblemStandard Model StatusIGT SolutionQuantum MechanicsAxiomatic (Assumed)Derived as the time-projection of $\tau$-deterministic diffusion. Probability is epistemic (lack of access to $\tau$).Dark Matter IdentityUnknown Particle (WIMP/Axion)Topological Solitons (Aninions). Stable, hyper-coherent knots of the $\text{R}$-field, protected from decay by topological charge.Dark EnergyFine-tuned $\Lambda$The natural potential energy ($V(\text{R} \to 0)$) of regions where the field failed to stabilize matter.CMB UniformitySolved by Inflation (Ad-hoc)Solved by the Super-Radiant Burst at $z \sim 1100$. Global entanglement prior to the burst ensures uniformity.Cosmic VoidsEmpty SpaceActive Thermodynamic Sinks. They absorb entropy from the visible universe, acting as the necessary heat sink for structure formation.Forces (Strong/Weak)Elementary Exchange ParticlesEmergent Geometric Effects. The Strong Force is $\text{R}$-field vacuum pressure; the Weak Force is geometric tunneling.III.
